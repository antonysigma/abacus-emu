# How to read this document

This example is written in a style of literate programming (Knuth 1984).
The (Javascript) source file is not presented in one go. Instead, we present the code fragments embed within the main text.

The document pre-processor application, `entangled`, will parse a system of code fragment references, known as `noweb` (Ramsey 1994), to assemble the machine-readable source files.
Inside source fragments you may encounter a line with `<<...>>` marks, which is a reference to another code fragment in the article.
